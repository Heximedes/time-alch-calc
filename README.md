***Note: This program is free to use, and always will be. This is the only place where you will be able to download a version from me. I do not own any other version other than the one that you see here. This program is not intended to provide an unfair advantage to anyone, but rather provide convenience as crafting multiple catalysts/materials can be a pain sometimes.***
