# Kastia Time Alchemy Calculator

This branch includes the compiled .exe file, if you'd like that instead. It will be flagged by Windows Defender (false positives). If you still want to run it as a .exe file, feel free to read over my spaghetti code and compile it into a .exe yourself. I used pyinstaller but there are a couple of other methods out there that can do the same thing.

***Note: This program is free to use, and always will be. This is the only place where you will be able to download a version from me. I do not own any other version other than the one that you see here. This program is not intended to provide an unfair advantage to anyone, but rather provide convenience as crafting multiple catalysts/materials can be a pain sometimes.***
